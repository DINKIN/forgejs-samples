# KEN Samples

This repository contains very simple samples, demonstrating the capatibilities of Kolor Eyes Next. [Another document](EXPLANATIONS.md) goes into details about some of the projects. It is recommended to read it if it is your first time creating a project.

## Test it

Run a server in the root folder of this directory. The index contain a list of available samples.

If you have Python installed, you can run
````bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer

# OR

python -m http.server
````

If you have Node.js installed, you can run these commands to install `http-server`, a simple zero-configuration command-line http server.
````bash
npm install http-server -g

http-server -p 8000
````

You can then browse [your localhost](http://localhost:8000).
